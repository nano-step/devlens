# Changelog


## 3.0.1 (2026-03-11)

### Improvements

- **@devlens/core** — `NetworkInterceptor` now supports `trackContracts: true` to attach JSON response bodies to network issues, enabling the API Contract Guardian plugin to learn and compare shapes automatically.
- **@devlens/dashboard** — "Generate Fix" button added per-issue. AI generates unified diff patches with copy-to-clipboard. Displayed alongside existing AI analysis.
- **@devlens/ui** — "SES" (Export Session) button added to panel header. Exports current issues as `.devlens` file with session metadata and timeline.
- **@devlens/ui** — `PanelInstance` now has `enable()` and `disable()` methods to programmatically show/hide the toggle button.
- **@devlens/ui** — `PanelConfig.autoOpenDashboard` option added (default: `false`). Dashboard no longer auto-opens — users must click the dashboard button explicitly.

### Docs

- Landing page updated for v3.0 with all new features (X-Ray Mode, Plugin System, API Contract, AI Auto-Fix, Session Recording, Async Tracker).

## 🚀 3.0.0 — "The Lens Update" (2026-03-11)

> **This is the biggest DevLens release ever.** 7 new features, 1 new package, and the architecture foundation for everything that comes next. DevLens is no longer just an error detector — it's a **development lens** that lets you see through your UI.

### ⭐ Headline: X-Ray Mode

**Hold `Alt` + hover over any element.** DevLens highlights the element and shows a tooltip with:

- Component name (React, Vue, or plain DOM)
- Props and state (extracted from React fiber / Vue instance)
- CSS classnames
- Number of DevLens issues related to that component

No browser extension needed. No DevTools panel to open. Just hold Alt and look. This is why it's called Dev**Lens**.

- `@devlens/ui` v2.0.0 — New `xray/` module: `createXRayMode()`, overlay rendering inside existing Shadow DOM, React fiber extraction (`__reactFiber$`), Vue 3 instance extraction (`__vueParentComponent`), vanilla DOM fallback. rAF-throttled mousemove, viewport-aware tooltip positioning. Enabled by default — disable with `xray: false` in PanelConfig.

### ⭐ Plugin Ecosystem

DevLens is now a **platform**. The engine supports first-class plugins with lifecycle management.

- `@devlens/core` v3.0.0 — **Breaking**: `DevLensEngine` interface now includes `registerPlugin()`, `unregisterPlugin()`, `getPlugin()`, `listPlugins()`, and `destroy()`. Existing code that creates engines works unchanged. Code that mocks the engine interface (tests) needs to add the new methods.
- New plugin API: `engine.registerPlugin({ name, version, setup, teardown })` — setup receives the engine, teardown is called on unregister or destroy.

### ⭐ API Contract Guardian

DevLens now auto-learns your API response shapes and alerts when they change unexpectedly.

- `@devlens/core` v3.0.0 — New `contract/` module: `createApiContractPlugin()`. Auto-infers JSON response shape on first request, compares subsequent responses, reports `api-contract` issues when fields disappear or change type. Configurable with `endpoints`, `ignoreFields`, `maxShapes`. New issue category: `api-contract` with `[CONTRACT]` console label.

### ⭐ AI Auto-Fix with Patch Generation

The AI no longer just explains problems — it generates code patches you can copy and apply.

- `@devlens/dashboard` v2.0.0 — New `generatePatch()` function. Uses existing source-fetcher pipeline to provide source code context to AI, then asks for a unified diff patch. Returns `PatchResult { file, diff, explanation }`. Supports all existing AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT).

### ⭐ Session Export/Import — QA-to-Dev Handoff

QA finds a bug → exports a `.devlens` session file → Dev imports it → sees exactly what QA saw. No more "I can't reproduce it."

- `@devlens/ui` v2.0.0 — New `session/` module:
  - `createSessionRecorder()` — records user interactions (clicks, inputs, navigation), DevLens issues, and network events into a timeline
  - `exportSession()` — downloads a `.devlens` JSON file with full session data (metadata, timeline, issues)
  - `parseSessionFile()` / `readFileAsText()` — import and validate `.devlens` files
  - `.devlens` file format v1.0: `{ version, sessionId, exportedAt, metadata, timeline[], issues[] }`

### ⭐ Async Flow Tracker

Detect hung promises, duplicate concurrent requests, and forgotten async operations.

- `@devlens/core` v3.0.0 — New `async/` module: `createAsyncTrackerPlugin()`. Wraps `fetch` to track async operation lifecycle. Reports `warn` when a fetch is pending longer than `timeoutMs` (default: 30s). Reports `info` on duplicate concurrent requests to the same endpoint. Configurable via `AsyncTrackerConfig`.

### ⭐ New Package: @devlens/web

Framework-agnostic adapter for vanilla JavaScript and Web Components.

- **@devlens/web** v0.1.0 — `initDevLens(config)` returns `{ engine, destroy() }`. Auto-installs network interceptor and global catcher. Zero framework dependencies. Works with Web Components, vanilla JS, Lit, Stencil, or any non-React/Vue setup.

### Breaking Changes

- **@devlens/core**: `DevLensEngine` interface now requires `registerPlugin`, `unregisterPlugin`, `getPlugin`, `listPlugins`, `destroy` methods. If you mock the engine in tests, add these methods to your mock.
- **@devlens/core**: New `IssueCategory` value `'api-contract'` — any code with exhaustive category checks needs updating.
- **@devlens/ui**: Package bumped to v2.0.0 due to new `PanelConfig.xray` option and `session/` module. No existing API removed.

## 0.2.0 (2026-02-26)

### Changes

- **@devlens/ui** v1.3.0 -- Panel UX polish + bug fixes + dashboard opener
  - **Fix**: Duplicate panel on page refresh / React StrictMode double-invocation -- `createDevLensPanel()` now checks if `#devlens-ui-root` already exists and skips re-init
  - **Fix**: Toggle button now shows a proper DevLens lens icon (SVG) instead of plain `DL` text; hovering shows the keyboard shortcut in a tooltip
  - **Fix**: Search input was not receiving keyboard events due to missing `pointer-events: auto` -- now explicitly set; keydown/keyup also stop propagation to prevent shortcut conflicts with the host app
  - **Fix**: Header buttons (JSON, CSV, CLR, ×) redesigned with SVG icons + labels -- cleaner, more polished appearance with distinct hover states; CLR button turns red on hover
  - **Fix**: Footer version label now reflects the actual `@devlens/core` version injected at build time (was hardcoded `v1.0.0`)
  - **New**: `createDashboardOpener(config)` -- opens the hosted DevLens dashboard in a new window/tab, tracks open/close state, exposes `open()`, `close()`, `isOpen`, `sessionId`, `dashboardLink`
  - **New**: `createDashboardReporter(opener)` -- reporter adapter that auto-opens the dashboard on the first detected issue
  - **New**: `PanelConfig.dashboardUrl` -- when set, a small dashboard-open button (monitor icon) appears above the main panel toggle for quick manual access

## 2.0.3 / 1.0.4 / 1.0.3 (2026-02-24, 02:46 UTC)

### Bug Fixes

- **@devlens/core** v2.0.3, **@devlens/react** v2.0.3 -- Fixed CJS/ESM module resolution (critical)
  - `package.json` declared `main: ./dist/index.cjs` and `exports.require: ./dist/index.cjs`, but tsup outputs `index.js` for CJS
  - This caused `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors in Webpack and any CJS consumer
  - Fixed: `main` now points to `./dist/index.js`, `module` to `./dist/index.mjs`, matching the actual build output
  - Aligned with the correct pattern already used by @devlens/ui and @devlens/vue

### Changes

- **@devlens/ui** v1.0.4, **@devlens/vue** v1.0.3 -- Version bump to depend on @devlens/core 2.0.3
- Added `npm run validate` script to verify all declared dist files exist after build

### Verified

- TDZ bug (ui panel crash on `buildHeader()`) was already fixed in v1.0.3 source and published dist -- confirmed no regression

### Published

- `@devlens/core@2.0.3` -- 2026-02-24 02:45 UTC
- `@devlens/react@2.0.3` -- 2026-02-24 02:46 UTC
- `@devlens/ui@1.0.4` -- 2026-02-24 02:46 UTC
- `@devlens/vue@1.0.3` -- 2026-02-24 02:46 UTC

## 2.0.2 / 1.0.3 / 1.0.2 (2026-02-24)

### Bug Fixes

- **@devlens/core** v2.0.2 -- Fixed console reporter noise: consolidated all detail lines into a single `consoleFn()` call to prevent per-line stack traces in browsers
- **@devlens/core** v2.0.2 -- Fixed multi-reporter: engine now composes custom reporter with console reporter so both panel and console receive issues
- **@devlens/ui** v1.0.3 -- Fixed TDZ crash: moved `let` declarations before `buildHeader()` call

### Changes

- **@devlens/react** v2.0.2, **@devlens/vue** v1.0.2 -- Version bump to depend on @devlens/core 2.0.2

## 2.0.0 (2026-02-24)

### Breaking Changes

- **@devlens/core**: Console reporter output format changed -- emoji icons replaced with text labels ([NET], [NULL], [UNDEF], [RENDER], [ERR], [REJ], [TYPE])
- **@devlens/core**: Tree-drawing characters in console output replaced with ASCII (`|-` and `\-`)

### New Packages

  - useDevLens() -- inject engine instance

### Changes
